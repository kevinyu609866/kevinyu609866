Hi, I'm Jia Kevin Yu, a recent university graduate with a Masters in Stats/Data Science and a Bachelors in Computer Science/Math. 

I am currently working as an analyst with the Los Angelos Clippers, specifically using data science tools and methods for revenue optimization. 

Throughout my professional career, I have amassed experience as a Quality Assurance Engineer using mostly SQL, Automation Engineer using Selenium/C#/SQL, Software Developer in VDF/C#, and now Data Analytics/Science with R, Python, and SQL.

I am looking for opportunities to apply and challenge my knowledge, in efforts to expand my knowledge in a vast and new field. 

I am open to all roles in: Data Analyst/Engineer/Developer/Scientist, Business Analyst, Business Intelligence Engineer/Developer/Analyst, and Software Developer in ML.

Throughout the years I've done multiple projects. In mostly chronological order they are:

  Houston Charity League: e-sports start up to host regional tournaments

  University Search: desktop application written in C# and SQL connections to search for universities within database that fits criteria (state, tuition, etc)

  Personal Website: hosted on github pages, and written using html/css/javascript

  Car Dealership Inventory: desktop application written in java and sql to store sales/inventory of a car dealership and record transactions

  NBA Playoff Prediction: model written in R to predict the 'playoff scores' of teams in the 2019-2020 season 

  Tesla Stock Price: model written in R to predict the fluctuation of TSLA stock price by day

  Predicting United Airlines Price using prices of AAL,DAL, and LUV (American, Delta, and Southwest): model written in R to predict the daily price of United using the prices 
  of American, Delta, Southwest, and T-3, T-2, T-1 daily prices of each of those.

  NBA Statistical Analysis: model written in R to analyze what leads to a team's success

  Handwriting/Font Classifcation: model written in R to identify handwriting fonts- data in 20x20 pixel images on grayscale

  Live Image Recognition: model written in python to predict camera images in realtime (cv2)


My data science kit includes but not limited to: Tableau, PowerBI, R, Python, SQL, Spark, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, keras, tensorflow, PCA, KNN, K-means, SVM, RF, Linear/Logistic Regression, Neural Networks/Convoultional NN, NLP (basic), and cv2


Currently, I am still looking for positions to evolve myself within this field.
